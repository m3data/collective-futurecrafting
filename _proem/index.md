<p>My heart is bursting. Our world is hurting.<br>
A want to heal, I want to feel.</p>

<p>The pain of my child grieving for a future lost.<br>
His tears tell a tale.</p>

<p>A bird no longer singing.<br>
A river no longer flowing.<br>
A flower no longer growing.<br>
A future he thought was glowing.</p>

<p>The earth cracks open, and the sky grows heavy with forgetting.<br>
I reach beyond my grasp.<br>
I feel alone.</p>

<p>The calling of my ancestors.<br>
The song of those unborn.<br>
To feel. To dream. To act.</p>

<p>To imagine.</p>

<p>The future cries before me, its voice raw with the echoes of what we’ve left undone.</p>

<p>A circle shines.</p>

<p>It calls to me, not in words,<br>
but in the soft hum of belonging.</p>

<p>I step closer, and find others waiting.<br>
Hands open.<br>
Eyes wide.</p>

<p>Hearts carrying the same ache.<br>
Awaiting a shared embrace.<br>
The wind whispering the same rhythmic words:</p>

<p><em>Can we dream together again?<br>
Dream again, together.</em></p>

<p>We sit.<br>
We speak.<br>
We listen.</p>

<p>Stories weave between us like threads of gold,<br>
binding what is broken that needs repair,<br>
composting what is dying that no longer serves.</p>

<p>A bird sings again, softly at first,<br>
But with the promise of dawn.</p>

<p>A river flows, not as it once did,<br>
But as it might yet become.</p>

<p>The circles grow, a living geometry of active hope.</p>

<p>Its rhythm hums in the street before me,<br>
a hum of the earth calling,<br>
its light reflects in the sky,<br>
its pulse beats within us.</p>

<p>We are not alone.<br>
We are circles within circles.<br>
Life within life.</p>

<p>The future no longer cries.<br>
It whispers.<br>
It dreams.<br>
It waits for our hands and hearts to craft it.</p>

<p>And so, together, we begin.</p>
