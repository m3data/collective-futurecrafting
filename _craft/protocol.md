    <h2>A protocol proposition</h2>
    <p>The vision for Collective Futurecrafting is to codesign the digital fabric that can support it as not just a governance and collective action network, but also as a comprehensive collective intelligence system.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to create a living infrastructure that can support the emergence of a planetary-scale regenerative civilization.</p>

  <h2>Circles: Seeds of Change</h2>
  <p>Like seeds containing the potential for mighty trees, Circles are the foundational units of transformation. They come in two vital forms:</p>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Hyper-local Circles</h3>
    <p>Intimate groups of 3-7 people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build deep relational trust through regular gathering</li>
      <li>Address tangible local challenges through direct action</li>
      <li>Learn through cycles of prototyping and reflection</li>
      <li>Create ripples of change that inspire others</li>
      <li>Root their work in place and community</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Steward Circles</h3>
    <p>Wisdom-keeping groups of 5-9 experienced practitioners who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nurture the growth of new circles through mentorship</li>
      <li>Safeguard the integrity of our shared principles</li>
      <li>Help navigate complexity and challenge</li>
      <li>Weave connections across the network</li>
      <li>Support the protocol's evolution through lived experience</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Like healthy cells in living tissue, each Circle maintains its unique identity while contributing to the health of the whole system.</p>

  <h2>CLANs: Weaving the Web</h2>
  <p>Community Learning and Action Nodes (CLANs) are like mycelial networks, creating living bridges between Circles and amplifying their impact through collaboration.</p>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Core Functions</h3>
    <ul class='protocol-list'>
      <li>Connect Circles working on related challenges</li>
      <li>Pool resources, knowledge, and capabilities</li>
      <li>Scale successful prototypes across communities</li>
      <li>Bridge different ways of knowing and doing</li>
      <li>Foster bioregional understanding and action</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Key Participants</h3>
    <ul class='protocol-list'>
      <li>Active Circles ready for broader collaboration</li>
      <li>Community organizations and institutions</li>
      <li>Traditional knowledge keepers and local experts</li>
      <li>Other CLANs sharing common watersheds or challenges</li>
      <li>Steward Circles providing guidance and support</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class='protocol-note'>CLANs operate like nature's resource distribution networks, ensuring that nutrients (knowledge, resources, support) flow where they're needed most while preserving local autonomy and diversity.</p>

<div class='protocol-section'>
  <h2>Rhiozomes: Living Systems at Scale</h2>
  <p>Named after the horizontal stem systems that help plants spread and regenerate, Rhiozomes connect CLANs into bioregional networks capable of large-scale regeneration.</p>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Vital Functions</h3>
    <ul class='protocol-list'>
      <li>Coordinate action across watersheds and ecosystems</li>
      <li>Bridge local wisdom with planetary needs</li>
      <li>Enable polycentric self-governance</li>
      <li>Facilitate fair resource distribution</li>
      <li>Track collective impact and learning</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class='protocol-subsection'>
    <h3>Essential Elements</h3>
    <ul class='protocol-list'>
      <li>Networks of collaborating CLANs</li>
      <li>Environmental sensing and feedback systems</li>
      <li>Shared resource pools and redistribution mechanisms</li>
      <li>Knowledge commons and learning exchanges</li>
      <li>Cross-bioregional coordination platforms</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class='protocol-note'>Like river systems connecting diverse watersheds, Rhiozomes help local actions flow into coherent planetary transformation while respecting the unique character of each place.</p>
