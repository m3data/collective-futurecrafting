## The Building Blocks

Our protocol is built on four interconnected elements: Circles, CLANs, Rhiozomes, and the WISDOM Protocol. Together, they create a living system for transformation.

<h2>Circles: where it all begins</h2>

<p>We envision many types of circles emerging, each playing a vital role in the ecosystem of change:</p>

<h3>Hyper-local circles</h3>
Small groups of 3-7 people who:
- Meet regularly to build trust and connection
- Address immediate local challenges
- Learn through direct action and reflection
- Create ripples of change in their communities

<h3>Steward Circles</h3>
Groups of 5-9 experienced members who:
- Guide and mentor other circles
- Maintain the integrity of the protocol
- Help navigate challenges
- Support the network's evolution

Think of circles like cells in a living organism—small but mighty, each playing its unique part in the whole.

## CLANs: Networks of Action

Community Learning and Action Nodes (CLANs) weave circles together into powerful networks of collaboration.

### What They Do
- Connect multiple circles in a region
- Pool resources and knowledge
- Scale successful prototypes
- Create bridges between communities
- Foster bioregional collaboration

### Who's Involved
- Active Circles working on local challenges
- Community organizations and institutions
- Local experts and wisdom keepers
- Other CLANs with shared interests

Like mycelial networks in a forest, CLANs create the connections that help good ideas and resources flow where they're needed.

## Rhiozomes: Bioregional Networks

Rhiozomes connect CLANs across bioregions, creating the capacity for large-scale transformation.

### Their Role
- Coordinate across watersheds and ecosystems
- Bridge local and planetary needs
- Enable regional governance
- Share resources at scale
- Track collective impact

### Core Elements
- Networks of active CLANs
- Regional institutions and experts
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Resource-sharing mechanisms
- Knowledge commons

Like river systems connecting watersheds, Rhiozomes help local actions flow into planetary impact.

## The WISDOM Protocol: Our Digital Nervous System

WISDOM (Wiser Innovation Symbiotically Designed for Organismal Mutualism) connects and coordinates all parts of the network.
" %}

### Key Components

**Digital Infrastructure**
- Governance tokens for collective decisions
- Social tokens recognizing contributions
- Shared knowledge and resource platforms
- Environmental impact tracking

**Social Architecture**
- Decision-making frameworks
- Resource allocation systems
- Conflict resolution processes
- Learning and adaptation protocols

### How It Works

The WISDOM Protocol:
- Facilitates trust-based collaboration
- Ensures transparent decision-making
- Tracks and validates impact
- Enables resource sharing
- Supports continuous learning

Like nature's signaling systems, WISDOM helps the network sense, respond, and adapt to change.

The protocol isn't just a set of rules—it's a living system that evolves with the communities using it. Each part supports the others, creating resilience through relationship.

By mimicking nature's patterns, we create conditions for:
- Deep collaboration
- Local autonomy
- Regional coordination
- Global impact"
