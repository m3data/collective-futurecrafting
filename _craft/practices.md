    <h2>Somatic Crafting</h2>
    <p>A set of kriyas (ritualised movements and breathwork) designed for each CF <a href='#'>principle</a>. These practices support embodiment, reflection, and individual and collective healing by connecting participants to the principle somatically, emotionally, and collectively.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Movement: Use gestures that mimic giving and receiving.</li>
                    <li>Breathwork: Introduce breathing patterns that emphasize flow and balance.</li>
                    <li>Reflection: Pause for journaling or sharing about how the kriya resonated emotionally and physically.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Close with a collective practice, such as a shared chant or grounding exercise.</li>
