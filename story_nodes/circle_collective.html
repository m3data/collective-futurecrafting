<p>The Elder leads you to a still pool nestled in ancient stones. Its surface reflects not just sky, but impossible geometries of shared dreaming:</p>

<p>“Here is where the dreams of many flow together, like rivers joining the sea. Watch how each ripple affects all others, how no dream exists alone. Some say this pool reaches down to the first dream that dreamed the world into being, and up into dreams not yet dreamed.</p>

<p>When circles gather in deep listening, they create pools like this in the space between their hearts. Each story dropped like a stone sends ripples through the collective imagination. Each vision shared creates new patterns of possibility.</p>

<p>But beware - not all that stirs in these depths is meant to surface. Some dreams must gestate in darkness, like seeds in winter soil. Others are bridges between what was and what could be, visible only in twilight moments of shared wonder.”</p>

<p>The pool’s surface begins to shift, showing fragments of memory and possibility - circles gathered in times of both celebration and challenge, weaving their dreams into maps of transformation.</p>
