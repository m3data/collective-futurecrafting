<p>You enter a grove where circles ripple outward like stones dropped in still water, each ring touching and intersecting with others in an ever-expanding dance of connection. Here, many voices braid themselves into songs of shared purpose, each circle a unique note in a greater harmony.</p>

<p>The air thrums with the possibility of what happens when circles begin to dream together. Shadows of ancient gatherings flicker at the edge of vision - tribes and clans who knew the power of weaving their gifts into something greater than themselves.</p>

<p>In the center, a pattern forms in the dancing shadows - the first CLAN, a galaxy of circles spinning in harmonious orbit around shared dreams of flourishing. Like planets around a star, each circle maintains its own rhythm while contributing to the greater dance.</p>

<p>You witness how wisdom flows between circles like water between pools, how strength grows not through gathering power but through sharing it, how each voice adds its unique tone to the symphony of becoming.</p>

<p>What wisdom calls to you from this dance of many becoming one?</p>
