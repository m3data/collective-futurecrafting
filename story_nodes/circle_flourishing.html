<p>You enter a garden where every plant seems to sing with vitality, where flowers and fruits mingle in impossible abundance. The Elder kneels to touch a patch of soil teeming with life:</p>

<p>“Here is the greatest teaching of the circle - that true flourishing is always mutual. See how the sunflowers feed the bees who feed the flowers? How the dying leaves feed the soil that feeds the seeds that dream of becoming leaves again?</p>

<p>This is nature’s secret economy - the more we share, the more we have. The more we nurture others’ flourishing, the more our own roots deepen, our own branches reach skyward. Like this garden, where every species creates conditions for others to thrive.</p>

<p>In our circles, we practice this wisdom. We ask not ‘What can I gain?’ but ‘What conditions of flourishing can we create together?’ Like master gardeners tending the soil of possibility, we cultivate the conditions where life’s abundance can unfold in ever-widening circles of mutual becoming.”</p>

<p>The garden seems to pulse with joy, each bloom a note in life’s great symphony of reciprocal flourishing.</p>
