<p>The Elder’s eyes gleam like dewdrops catching first light, holding worlds within worlds:</p>

<p>“See how the tree breathes out what we breathe in, how the wolf’s hunger keeps the deer swift and strong, how the death of stars births worlds anew. This is the dance of giving that weaves all life into one breathing body.</p>

<p>Watch how the mycelia beneath our feet share stories of abundance through their underground networks, how flowers offer nectar to bees who carry messages of life between blooms. Every gift moves in circles, like water seeking the sea only to return as rain.</p>

<p>In the circle, we remember this truth: that giving and receiving are but two steps in the same sacred dance. When we give, we create channels for abundance to flow. When we receive with grace, we honour the giver and keep the circle whole.”</p>

<p>You feel the pulse of this wisdom in your bones - the rhythm of give and take that drums beneath all things. Each breath becomes a prayer of reciprocity, each heartbeat an echo of this eternal exchange.</p>

<p>Which aspect of this dance calls you deeper?</p>
