<p>You step onto a spiral path that glows with dawnâ€™s first light. Here, shadows of ancient circles ripple through time - gatherings around fires that held back the dark, beneath trees that remembered the first songs, in spaces where stories wove communities into being.</p>

<p>The air shimmers with memories not your own - countless circles spanning ages, each one a flame kindled against forgetting, each one a seed of possibility planted in the soil of shared dreams.</p>

<p>In this eternal moment, you feel the pull of circle-time, where past and future spiral together like dancers weaving a pattern older than words. Every step on this path echoes with the footfalls of those who gathered before, their wisdom whispering in the spaces between heartbeats.</p>

<p>What calls to you from these ancient rhythms? Which story seeks your listening heart?</p>
