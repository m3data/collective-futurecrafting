<p>A spiral of golden light blooms in the air before you, its curves containing smaller spirals that contain still smaller ones, infinite in their elegant recursion:</p>

<p>“See how the nautilus builds its home, chamber within chamber, each space holding memories of the last while reaching toward the next? This is the pattern of nested circles - the way of growth that nature discovered eons ago.</p>

<p>Just as a tree is a community of cells forming branches forming canopies forming forests, so do our circles nest within circles. Each level preserves the intimacy of the small while participating in the power of the large. Like Russian dolls holding stories within stories, or like dreams dreaming dreamers dreaming dreams.</p>

<p>This is how we weave networks of nurture, each circle complete in itself yet part of ever-widening spheres of care. The wisdom of the hearth fire flows into the wisdom of the village green flows into the wisdom of the bioregion - each scale both container and contained.”</p>

<p>The spiral continues its hypnotic dance, showing you how every circle is both a whole unto itself and a seed of greater wholeness.</p>
