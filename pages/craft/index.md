    quote="Collective Futurecrafting is designed to be a living practice, a way of being, a way of seeing, a way of doing that is always in flux, always in dialogue with the world around us. So play with these principles, patterns and practices as you wish. Embody them, adapt them and share learnings with the communities you are part of along the way."
