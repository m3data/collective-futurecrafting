    <h2>Let's be real</h2>
    <p>Our world is at a breaking point. You can feel it, right? Climate chaos, social fragmentation, failing institutions, techno-optimists, surviellance captialism, the enshittification of our information ecologies—it's enough to make anyone want to pull the covers over their head beacause it's all too big, too complex, and well, damn right overwhelming.</p>
    <p>But within this beautiful mess lies an opportunity. Not just to adapt to the turbulance of the here and now, and what's coming, but to reimagine what's possible.</p><p>This our collective coming of age rite of passage. Our call to step into the unknown, to face and integrate shadows of our past, and to craft a future that's worthy of seven generations after us.</p>
    <p>Collective Futurecrafting has emerged from this opportunity, as an invocation to all of us Earthians to help transform how we relate - to ourselves, each other, and the living world we are part of. And from within and through this transformation to craft something beautiful from the pieces of what's breaking.</p>

    content="<h2>A crisis of imagination</h2>
    <p>Humanity is trapped in a crisis of imagination, oscillating between two extremes reflecting the dominant narratives of our times.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dystopian:</strong> We're doomed, the world's ending, and there's nothing we can do about it.</li>
      <li><strong>Utopian:</strong> Technology will save us, and we'll all live in perfect harmony with the help of our AI overlords.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Neither of these stories helps us navigate the real world we're living in. They keep us stuck in a cycle of fear and inaction, waiting for someone else to fix things for us.</p>"
    accordion_content="<p>Apocalyptic narratives abound as we find it easy to imagine that we're all doomed! The planet's dying, society's collapsing, and the best we can do is hunker down and hope for the best. Think of it like Mad Max meets The Hunger Games with a dash of Orwellian hot sauce, minus the cool costumes.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, we have the techno-optimists who believe that technology will save us. We'll transcend our biological limitations and the laws of thermodynamics and all live in perfect harmony as happy consumers, owning nothing, renting everything, all with the help of our AGI overlords, and we'll never have to worry about anything ever again. Picture Star Trek meets The Matrix with a sly side of Silicon Valley hubris.</p>
    <p>And there are many complex and nuanced stories in between. But the dominant narratives of our time tend to fall into these two camps, leaving us feeling powerless and disconnected from ourselves, each other and the world we're living in.</p>

    <h2>Enter Thrutopia</h2>
    <p>But what if there's a third story? Not over or under our challenges, but through them? A story where we're not victims or saviors, but <strong>crafters</strong> of our own shared future on this beautiful planet we call home?</p>
    <p>Thrutopia is a story of active hope, not because everything will be okay, but because we have the power to make it so. It's a story of courage, not because we know what's coming, but because we're willing to face it together.</p><p>It's not about perfection—it's about loving presence, community, creativity and care.</p>"
    accordion_content="<p>Thrutopia isn't about perfect solutions or total collapse. It's about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Embracing the messiness of life and learning to navigate it with grace and courage.</li>
      <li>Working together to craft a world that's beautiful, just, and regenerative for all beings.</li>

        <div class='accordion__content'>
          <p>The Three Horizons Framework is a way of understanding the past, present, and future as interconnected and interdependent. It helps us see where we've come from, where we are, and where we're going.</p>
          <p>Each horizon represents a different way of thinking, doing, and being in the world. By mapping and playing between these horizons, we can see how they interact and influence each other, and how we can craft the future we want to born.</p>

<h2>Horizon one (H1) - the dominant systems in decline</h2><p>This is the world of business as usual. Extractive economies, top-down control, endless growth on a finite planet.
It represents the institutions, ways of thinking, doing and creating that currently dominate but are no longer fit for purpose. These systems—extractive economies, hierarchical governance, and consumer-driven cultures—are at odds with sustaining life on Earth.</p>
