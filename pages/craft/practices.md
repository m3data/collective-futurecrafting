    <h2>Living practices for living systems</h2>
    <p>These practices are not rigid techniques but living ways of crafting that help us embody the <a href="{{ '/craft/principles' | relative_url }}">principles</a> and express the <a href="{{ '/craft/patterns' | relative_url }}">patterns</a> of Collective Futurecrafting. Each practice weaves together multiple patterns while staying grounded in our core principles.</p>
