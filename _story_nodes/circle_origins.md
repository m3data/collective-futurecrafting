You step onto a spiral path that glows with dawn's first light. Here, shadows of ancient circles ripple through time - gatherings around fires that held back the dark, beneath trees that remembered the first songs, in spaces where stories wove communities into being.

The air shimmers with memories not your own - countless circles spanning ages, each one a flame kindled against forgetting, each one a seed of possibility planted in the soil of shared dreams.

In this eternal moment, you feel the pull of circle-time, where past and future spiral together like dancers weaving a pattern older than words. Every step on this path echoes with the footfalls of those who gathered before, their wisdom whispering in the spaces between heartbeats.

What calls to you from these ancient rhythms? Which story seeks your listening heart?
