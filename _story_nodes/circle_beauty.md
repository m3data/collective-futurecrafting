The air shimmers like a veil between worlds as the Elder gestures to a broken clay vessel lying in a patch of wild flowers:

"See how the crack in this ancient vessel has become a channel for new life? How moss and tiny blooms have made their home in what we might call imperfection? This is the way of unexpected beauty - it flowers most gloriously in the spaces between our plans, in the cracks of our certainty.

Like mushrooms after rain, like stars born in the death-clouds of their ancestors, like songs that rise unbidden from grief - beauty follows its own mysterious logic. It cannot be commanded or contained. It can only be welcomed, like a shy wild creature, with patience and wonder."

The broken vessel seems to glow from within, its imperfections transformed into a map of possibility. You begin to see how every ending holds seeds of beginning, how beauty braids itself through both shadow and light.
