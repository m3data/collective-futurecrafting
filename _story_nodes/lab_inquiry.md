The gardener offers you a handful of strange seeds, each one pulsing with its own inner light. As you look closer, you realize each seed is actually a question waiting to be planted:

"These are the rarest seeds we grow," she murmurs, "beautiful questions that can crack open reality like spring stems cracking winter soil. See how each one shimmers with its own mystery? That's the light of genuine curiosity, the kind that comes from the heart's deepest wondering.

Some questions are quick-sprouting annuals - 'What if we tried this?' 'How might we solve that?' Others are slow-growing perennials that take seasons to flower: 'What does it mean to belong?' 'How do we heal what's broken in our world?'

The art lies in knowing which questions to plant where, when to water them with attention, when to let them rest in darkness. Most importantly, we must learn to love the questions themselves, to trust their slow unfurling. Like trees growing towards light they know but cannot see."

She shows you how to plant a beautiful question - gently, with reverence, creating space for mystery to take root.
