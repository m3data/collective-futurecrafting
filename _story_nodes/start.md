In the time before time, when dreams and reality danced as one, the Great Circle gathered beneath stars that sang ancient songs. Here, in this liminal space between what was and what could be, three paths shimmer with possibility.

Each path pulses with its own rhythm, its own story waiting to be woven into the greater tapestry of becoming. The air itself seems to hold its breath, waiting for your choice.

To your left, a path glows with dawn's first light, whispering tales of circles ancient and new. Before you, a way opens where many voices braid themselves into harmony. To your right, a grove beckons, where dreams take root in living soil.

Which thread calls to your heart's deepest knowing?
