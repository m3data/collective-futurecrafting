The Elder lifts an ancient clay vessel, its surface worn smooth by countless hands. Moonlight pools within its hollow like liquid silver:

"To receive fully is one of life's deepest arts," they whisper, "as profound as the earth receiving rain, as delicate as a flower receiving light. See how this vessel creates emptiness shaped perfectly for holding? This is the first wisdom - before we can receive, we must create space within.

Many think giving is the greater gift, but watch how the ocean receives every river without diminishing their song, how night receives our fears without judgment, how soil receives the seed and transforms it into forests.

To receive with grace is to honor the giver, to complete the circle of exchange. Every gift needs both hands - one to offer, one to accept. In this dance, each role is sacred, each gesture necessary for life's great wheel to turn."

The vessel glows softly, reminding you of all the ways you are held - by earth, by sky, by the great circle of life itself.
