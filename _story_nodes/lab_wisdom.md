In a sun-dappled clearing, circles gather to share the harvest of their questioning. The air is rich with the fragrance of ripened insight, sweet as autumn apples:

"Welcome to the Harvest Festival," beckons an elder gardener, her basket overflowing with strange and wonderful fruits. "This is where we gather what our questions have grown, though the gathering itself is an art. Some wisdom-fruits fall readily into waiting hands. Others must be carefully picked, like tea leaves, at just the right moment.

See how these insights glow different colors? The golden ones came from questions about belonging, the silver from wonderings about time, the deep blue from mysteries of transformation. Each has its own taste, its own medicine for the soul.

But remember - true wisdom isn't in the fruit itself, but in how we share it, how we compost the rinds to feed next season's questions. Like a forest sharing nutrients through underground networks, our understanding grows richer when it flows between circles."

Around you, circles exchange their wisdom-fruits with ceremonial grace, each sharing becoming a seed for new questions, new wonderings, new growth.
