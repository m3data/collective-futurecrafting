The Elder's voice rises like smoke from ancient fires, each word a spark dancing between worlds:

"In the dreaming time, when the stars first learned their dance, there was no separation between earth and sky, between you and I. All beings knew their place in the great round of existence. Each creature wore their belonging like a second skin, each tree sang its part in the endless song of becoming.

But as dreams began to fragment and hearts grew distant, something was remembered: the circle. First came the moon, drawing her perfect arc across the night sky. Then the sun, teaching us the circle of days. The seasons followed, spinning their eternal wheel.

And our ancestors, watching these celestial dancers, understood: to heal what was broken, they must sit as the stars sit - in circles within circles, each voice a flame in the darkness, each story a thread in the great weaving."

The story settles around you like falling leaves, each word a seed seeking soil in your understanding. In the silence that follows, you feel the weight of this ancient knowing, heavy as dew on morning grass.

Which thread of wisdom calls for your gentle tugging?
