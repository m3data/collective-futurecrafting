Like rain pooling on parched earth, slowly finding channels to flow together into streams, then rivers, so too do our collective responses to climate challenges begin as scattered actions, gradually connecting into powerful currents of change.

This is the essence of **Adapting Communities to Thrive (ACT)**. Co-creating a living, participatory journey where our diverse knowledge, experiences, and visions converge to map adaptation pathways. And today, we're opening a new channel for this convergence: **the ACT Mural**.

This digital canvas can become a living map of our collective intelligence, a space where the wisdom of many Earthians can mingle and multiply, revealing patterns that none of us could see alone.

  <h2>Weaving wisdom across communities</h2>
  <p>The challenges we face are too complex for isolated solutions. No single perspective or expertise will be enough.</p>
  <p>Instead, we need to weave together diverse knowledge, experiences, and creativity from the head, heart and hands of our communities.</p>

## Why a Mural for Adaptation?

The scale and complexity of climate adaptation requires a new form of collaborative intelligence. A form that can honor local knowledge while enabling shared learning across communities. One that inspire us to imagine and co-create a future where we can thrive.

The ACT Mural offers a space where:

- **Local wisdom becomes visible** alongside scientific insights
- **Emerging experiments** can be connected to reveal patterns
- **Future visions** can be co-created across different perspectives
- **Your voice** joins a growing tapestry of community adaptation strategies

This isn't just another online whiteboard, it's living map of collective intelligence that feeds directly into the upcoming ACT events and beyond, helping to shape tangible action and policy.

## Exploring the Three Horizons

The Mural is structured around the **Three Horizons framework**: a powerful way to imagine and navigate transformation.

- **Horizon 1: Business-as-Usual & Current Challenges**: What's holding us back? What challenges do you see in your community? What are people saying—or not saying—about climate change?

- **Horizon 2: The Transition Zone**: How might we adapt together? What seeds are you planting, both literal and metaphorical? What emerging experiments inspire you? How might we build bridges between composting the old and crafting the new?

- **Horizon 3: The Future of Thriving Communities**: Imagine writing letters from 2035. What does an adapted, thriving community look and feel like? What do you see, hear, smell, and feel in this flourishing future?

Each horizon needs your caring contribution, and you can move freely between them as you explore different perspectives.

Through these connections, something greater than the sum of parts begins to emerge.

## How best to engage with the Mural

Ready to join this collaborative space? Here's how to make the most of it:

1. **Set aside 20-30 minutes** for thoughtful engagement (the Mural works best on desktop browsers)
2. **Start in the sandbox** if this is your first time using Mural, learn how to create sticky notes, add images, and explore the basic tools
3. **Check out the "How & What to Contribute" section** for ideas on different ways to participate
4. **Get inspired by community initiatives** by exploring the video case studies of climate adaptation projects across NSW
5. **Choose which horizon you want to explore first** and add your voice through:
   - Sticky notes sharing your experiences, worries, or hopes
   - Images from your community showing adaptation in action
   - Poems or stories about adaptation journeys
   - Letters from the future imagining thriving communities
   - Links to projects that inspire you
   - Questions that need exploring

Remember, this isn't about having perfect ideas or polished contributions. It's about bringing your authentic perspective into a growing collective intelligence. The Mural is a conversational place to both share and be inspired by others.

## What happens next?

The Mural isn't a static exercise. It's a living process and just one part of the broader ACT journey. As patterns emerge, connections form, and insights arise, we'll be:

- Hosting some online workshops with work through the ACT Mural experience together. <a href="https://tally.so/r/wkvNv1" target="_blank">Register your interest here</a> to be notified about upcoming sessions.
- Weaving your contributions into futher stories and imagination exercises to share back with the larger community.
- Bringing community stories, voices and wisdom into the **AdaptNSW Forum**
- Creating a **visual archive of community wisdom** that continues to evolve
- Identifying opportunities for **collaborative action** across communities

Your contributions become part of a growing body of knowledge about how we might adapt and thrive together. This participatory approach reflects a core insight: adaptation isn't something done *to* communities, but *by* communities, drawing on their inherent wisdom and creativity.

_Note: The Mural is a public space, and your contributions will be visible to others. Please be aware of your own privacy and that of others you may share stories about, and only share content that you are comfortable with being public._
