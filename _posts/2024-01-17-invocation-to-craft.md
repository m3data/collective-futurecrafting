There's a quiet space between worlds, where old patterns compost and new possibilities germinate, where a knowing is stirring. Like mycelial networks sensing changes in the soil, like ancient songs remembered in dreams, this knowing whispers through the marrow of our collective body: *it is time*.

Time to remember. Time to gather. Time to craft.

> We are the ones we have been waiting for. The future-weavers, the pattern-breakers and makers, the circle-keepers who dare to dream differently.

## Pattern Re-Cognition

Each Friday, as the sun traces its arc across my garden, I sit in communion with this emergence. I devote energy, space and time to yarn with fellow crafter about what is and what can be. And what began as a personal ritual of contemplation and connection has blossomed into something more—a living practice that now is slowly weaving through school communities and neighborhood gatherings, through quiet conversations and bold experiments in collective dreaming.

This practice carries many names across times and cultures. Today, we call it Collective Futurecrafting—not because it's new, but because it needs naming in this moment of profound transformation. It's a re/cognition of ancestral patterns, of playing in future possibilities, of the courage and care that is in the eternal present moment.

## The Warrior's Call

This is not a call to arms but to hearts. To the warrior-mystic in each of us who knows that the future isn't something that happens to us—it's something we craft together, through small, intentional moves that ripple outward through networks of play, care and possibility.

The patterns are already living:
- In the beeing of circles of parents reimagining our local school P&C
- In garden conversations where neighbors dare to dream of regenerative communities
- In quiet experiments with new forms of gathering and decision-making
- In the spaces between thoughts where futures whisper their possibilities

## The Mystic's Practice

The craft begins simply, though its implications run deep as mycorrhizal networks:

1. **Gather in Circles**: Find your fellow crafters (3-7 is the sweet spot where magic happens). Like atoms forming molecules, these small groups become the basic cells of transformation.

2. **Root in Place**: Let your locality be your teacher. The soil beneath your feet, the stories in your streets, the wisdom in your watershed—all hold clues to what wants to emerge.

3. **Practice the Patterns**: 
   - Share stories that weave past, present and future
   - Listen deeply to what life is asking of you
   - Prototype small moves that might ripple outward
   - Reflect and learn in cycles, like the seasons or lunations

4. **Share Your Learning**: Let your stories spiral outward through networks of relationship. Use #CollectiveFuturecrafting to connect with other crafters.

> In times of great transition, the smallest actions can seed the largest transformations. Like a butterfly's wings stirring hurricanes, like spores carrying forests' futures on the wind.

## A Living Invitation

This is just the beginning. In my own practice, working with fellow steward crafters, we're breathing life into these patterns through:
- Community and place reimagining through school P&C initiatives
- Place-based perpetual pilots that test and evolve these practices
- Regular circles where we process collective grief and craft new possibilities
- Documentation and sharing of our learning journey

Larger architectures of collaboration are dreamed of—CLANs connecting circles across bioregions, Rhiozomes weaving larger tapestries of change, protocols that mirror nature's own information highways. But these are provocations, seeds of possibility that will grow in their own time, in their own way.

For now, the invocation is simpler: Gather. Listen. Craft.

The future isn't a destination we arrive at, but a garden we tend together. It emerges through our daily practices, through the quality of our attention, through every small move that aligns with life's regenerative patterns.

The time is now. The place is here. And you—yes, you reading these words—are essential to this unfolding.

Will you craft with me?
