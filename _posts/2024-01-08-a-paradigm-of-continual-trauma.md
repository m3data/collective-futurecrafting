In between heartbeats, between the digital pulse of notifications, the mechanical rhythm of commerce and the ongoing disenfranchisement of pseudodemocracy, there lies a wound. Not a clean cut, but a complex web of interconnected injuries—to our bodies, our communities, our planet. Like a death of 1000 papercuts on our bodies and psyches. This wound speaks in the language of anxiety that keeps us awake at night, in the grief that catches in our throat when we read of another species lost, in the bone-deep exhaustion of trying to stay afloat in systems designed for extracting value from our lives. This is the wound of collective trauma, a wound that is not just personal but systemic, not just individual but shared.

## The Anatomy of Collective Wounding

Our systems of harm are ingrained in the substrate of our society, connecting seemingly disparate points of pain into a vast and ongoing flow of trauma. This territory cannot really be accurately mapped, but it is felt in our lived experience, in our social bodies. We can however trace the threads of how we wound and are wounded, not to despair, but to understand—for in understanding lies the seeds of healing together.

### The Extractive Paradigm

Picture a tree being stripped of its bark, year after year. This is our extractive economy—a system that mistakes the stripping of life for the creation of value. In the mines, offices and factories, human bodies become resources to be depleted. Wellness programs less about care and more a simple ROI calculation to extract more and keep the bodies in the machine. In the clearcut forests and poisoned rivers, ecosystems become "externalities" on a spreadsheet, if accounted for at all.

This systematic exploitation creates what is termed "allostatic load"—the cumulative burden our bodies bear from constantly adapting to chronic stressors<sup>1</sup>. Like a rubber band stretched beyond its capacity, our physical and psychological systems begin to wear down under this constant strain. The trauma manifests in:

- The chronic tension in workers' bodies, holding the stress of precarity and continual cognitive dissonance.
- The severed connections between communities and their ancestral lands, people and ecological systems.
- The quiet shame of consumers caught in cycles of rampant consumption they know are unsustainable and unfulfilling.
- The deep grief of witnessing the destruction of the natural world and the loss of what anthropologists call "cultural keystone species"—those vital and living elements that anchor human communities to place and purpose<sup>2</sup>.

These patterns enter our psyche, teaching us to mine our own wellbeing for productivity, to strip our days of rest and regeneration in service of endless growth. To ignore the pain within ourselves, our families, our communities and our planet is to perpetuate the patterns of extraction that create it.

### The Architecture of Disconnection

Consider how mushrooms in a forest share nutrients and information through their mycelial web. Now imagine that web severed, each organism isolated. This is the architecture of our current systems—which has been described as "environmental captivity," where we find ourselves trapped within conditions that feel impossible to escape or transform<sup>3</sup>. We see this in:

- Education systems that separate mind from body, reason from intuition, human from nature, agency from collective action.
- Workplace structures that fragment tasks until meaning dissolves and workers become cogs in a machine.
- Digital interfaces that simulate connection while deepening our isolation, polarisation and addiction.
- Urban designs and a built environment that wall us off from the natural ecology that sustains us.
- Political systems that pit us against each other in a zero-sum game of power and amplify our sense of disempowerment and disenfranchisement.

The trauma lives in and through these patterns, in the loneliness that has become endemic to modern life, in the disconnection from our own bodies and the living world that sustains us. This is a disconnection that is not just a metaphorical wound—it is a physical and psychic reality that shapes our sense of self, our relationships, and our capacity to act in the world.

### The Trauma of False Hierarchies

Like a river forced into a concrete channel, hierarchical systems of oppression attempt to contain and control the natural flow of human diversity and creativity. These systems create what sociologist Johan Galtung termed "structural violence"—harm that emerges not from direct physical force but from the very architecture of our social, political, and economic systems<sup>4</sup>. This manifests in:

- Racial and colonial trauma that echoes through generations and shapes our sense of identity and belonging.
- Gender-based oppression that constrains the full expression of human potential and creativity.
- Economic inequality that creates chronic stress and intergenerational wounds in communities.
- Power structures that separate communities from their right to self-determination and self-governance.

The pain flows downstream, accumulating in bodies, psyches, and social systems. This manifests as physical and mental health challenges, such as cardiovascular disease, anxiety, and depression, which disproportionately affect those in marginalised or oppressed communities in our society.

### The Ecology of Harm

Environmental collapse isn't just happening "out there" in melting glaciers and forests being chopped down. It manifests in an endemic trauma—this psychological toll of living in a world where the very systems meant to sustain life have become agents of its destruction<sup>5</sup>. Or what Glenn Albrecht<sup>6</sup> calls "Solastalgia". This lives in our bodies as:

- Climate anxiety that colors our vision of the future
- Solastalgia—the distress caused by environmental change in our home places
- Ecological grief as we witness the sixth mass extinction
- Transgenerational trauma as communities face displacement and loss of traditional ways of life

This endemic trauma reflects a deeper wound: the severing of our relationship with the living world that sustains us.

### The Digital Enclosure

Like a garden surrounded by ever-higher walls, surveillance capitalism creates boundaries around our attention and agency:

- Our movements, preferences, and relationships become data to be harvested
- Algorithms shape our perception of reality, creating filter bubbles that fragment shared understanding
- The constant performance of digital life creates what sociologists call "presentation fatigue"
- Privacy becomes a luxury rather than a right

This creates what Van der Kolk describes as environmental captivity—a state where escape from harmful conditions seems impossible, leading to a kind of learned helplessness that perpetuates systemic trauma<sup>3</sup>.

## Seeds of Regeneration

Yet within these systems of trauma lie the seeds of their own transformation. Complexity theorists identify these as "positive deviants"—individuals and groups who find ways to thrive despite systemic constraints, creating unexpected solutions through creative adaptation<sup>6</sup>. We see this in:

- Communities reclaiming traditional ecological knowledge
- Workers organizing for dignity and purpose in their labor
- Young people demanding climate justice
- Artists and activists imagining new ways of being
- Indigenous leaders protecting bioregions
- Local communities creating alternative economies

These positive deviants show us that another way is possible, even within our current constraints.

## The Call to Collective Healing

This illustration of systemic trauma isn't meant to overwhelm but to illuminate. Like an experienced Shaman, we must learn to read the signs of the physical and psychic body to better understand these patterns of harm. Helping us all in locating the points of intervention and healing.

The work ahead is not just to bandage symptoms but to transform the underlying systems that perpetuate trauma. This requires a regenerative remembering—recalling and reimagining ways of living that support the flourishing of all life.

The wound that runs through our systems is also a portal. Through it, we might glimpse and then create something new: economies that regenerate rather than extract, technologies that connect rather than surveil, education that liberates rather than constrains, governance that emerges from the wisdom of living systems and larger circumferences of care. The birthing of a new social contract that is based on the principles of care, reciprocity, and regeneration.

In the end, this is a story not just of trauma but of possibility. For in mapping these wounds, we also map the pathways toward healing—toward what anthropologist Arturo Escobar calls "pluriversal worlds," where many ways of knowing, being, and healing can coexist and flourish.

> "It is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking, than it is to think yourself into a new way of acting."
― Millard Fuller

The question before us is not whether to heal, but how to become actively hopeful participants in the healing that wants to happen. The systems that wound us are not unchangeable. They are stories we've been telling ourselves, patterns we perpetuate, and we do have the power to tell—and live—new ones.
