A liminal space between worlds, beginnings and endings. And we must ask ourselves, given what we sense about this juncture in our history, how must we be? What must we do? What are we preparing to become?</p>

<p>Like mycelia sensing changes in the soil, there’s a deep knowing stirring in our collective body—a recognition that we stand at a threshold of profound transformation. This knowing has been whispering to me, and I sense to many others, through dreams and garden conversations, through data points and pattern re-cognition, through the quiet persistence of life finding new ways to flourish.</p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time marinating on what to write for this first post as the website births. How to write it, the stories to tell, the empirical research and wide boundary thinking and thinkers to draw on, those that have inspired this work, this craft that has been whispering to me, well, for much of my life. For what I feel is many lifetimes. Feeling through depths of ancestral patterns, journeys with magic chocolate, reflecting on the yarns with friends, local Elders, my dogs and the plants in the garden as I water them. Reflections on the quests I have been on. From the jungles of Mexico and Costa Rica, to Papua New Guinea and Australia.</p>

<p>We are always becoming and all that has been is compost for radicles to emerge in the present moment.</p>

  <h2>Seeds in the Garden of Time</h2>
  <p>For the past year, I sat in my backyard garden every Futurecrafting Friday. Being with the enormity of stimuli, sitting with the sense of something that wants to be born.</p>
  <p>Knowing what is spoken, can become. What is felt, can be done.</p> <p>And what is imagined can be crafted.</p>
  
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<p><br />
And there is a wonderful reimagining happening all around us. Like the fruiting bodies of the mycelium underneath the soil, popping up after the rains. Or how the undergrowth that begins thriving as an old tree dies and opens up the canopy. Initiatives all around the world to reimagine what it means to be citizens, to rewild, to repattern, to reconnect with ourselves, to re-cognise. Whispers in peoples dreams, in conversations in passing, in the quiet hum that is our yearning for deep belonging.</p>

<p>At the same time there is so much upheaval, turmoil, and continuation of trauma while <a href="https://www.planetaryhealthcheck.org/" target="_blank">Spaceship Earth’s vital signs</a> are flashing red. Wars across the world, wars on our psyches, ongoing exploitation of people, of forests, of our Earth. This cannot be ignored as it is in this trauma that lies the <span class="footnote-ref">radicle<sup>2</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip">A radicle is the first part of a seedling (a growing plant embryo) to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. See footnote for futher context.</span></span> seeds of healing if we are willing to work through it together.</p>

<h2 id="the-edge-of-transformation">The Edge of Transformation</h2>

<p>A more objective lens as a skeptical optimist looking at all the data points is that, yes, there is so much beauty emerging from what one might call a “raising of consciousness”. A rising of more wellbeing aligned policies, regenerative practices, circular design, Doughnut Economics, <a href="https://innerdevelopmentgoals.org/" target="_blank">Inner Development Goals</a>, cooperatives, web3 tech, etc etc. But the question is can it rise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/28/we-need-dramatic-social-and-technological-changes-is-societal-collapse-inevitable" target="_blank">fast enough</a> to bring about the radical transformation required for our deeply global civilisation to come into right relation with the web of life?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whether it is to be utopia or oblivion will be a touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment.”</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My more woo-er senses bring me to the belief that this is a cosmic story playing out that we are part of and we are destined to transform. A metamorphosis we must have as a species.</p>

</figure>

<p>The path to walk through all this is the one of preparing for the end times as we know it. For it is not a utopian or dystopian path we are on, it is <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rupert-read/thrutopia-why-neither-dys_b_18372090.html" target="_blank">Thrutopian</a>.</p>

<h2 id="walking-thrutopian-paths">Walking Thrutopian Paths</h2>

<p>In 2010 while I was a mature age student at uni I did a pivotal subject called Utopias &amp; Dystopias (read a <a href="https://www.m3data.me/new-dawns-creative-essay/" target="_blank">creative essay</a> I wrote for this subject). This period brought with it a wide immersion in the utopian and dystopian literature and a hint at the thinking that was to shape the trajectory of my work in the coming decade. My professor was Dr Jeremy Walker, someone I had admired and who had inspired me. His more <a href="https://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/mcs/article/view/8813" target="_blank">recent research work</a> on the Atlas Network, a shady web of people and “think-tanks” that colluded to support the No vote in Australia’s recent referendum is noteworthy. It symbolises the current power structures, patterns and institutions that must be composted as we find and craft Thrutopian paths to to what Glen Albrecht calls the <a href="https://symbioscene.com/invitation-to-the-symbiocene/" target="_blank">Symbiocene</a>. An era after the Anthropocene where we are in right relation with the Earth and all her beings.</p>

<p>Like composting itself, transformation requires both breaking down and building up. Over the past few years, I have noticed a deeper shift emerging—a dispersed movement focused on futures finding coherence. Not just the theoretical futures of an academic nature, these have increased in recent years as a result of the acknowledgement we have some serious adaption to do. But the lived futures being crafted in community gardens, citizen assemblies, platform coops, Decentralised Autonomous Organisations and Web3 communities,  around kitchen tables, in many spaces and places where people dare to dream differently.</p>

<p>Even in the political realms the Overton windows are seemingly shifting to more preferable policy. Of course there is variance based on where on this wonderful planet you are. And in my view none of what I see here where I am in Australia is radicle enough.</p>

<p>Yet we need not wait for politicians, for the WEFerati<sup>3</sup>, for Elonia Musk, for the current institutions to make the changes we most need for the transformation. It happens at the edges, in our communities, conversations and yarns. In the small rituals we practice. In the processing of our trauma and the quieter transformations we embrace.</p>

<p>This is what creates the conditions and paths to the Symbiocene.</p>

<h2 id="a-pattern-wanting-to-be-born">A Pattern Wanting to Be Born</h2>

<p>Sitting in my garden these past months, watching the interplay of sunlight through leaves and the dance of ecology, something has been chrysalising.</p>

<p>Whispering to me in the quiet moments between thoughts, in the spaces where past and future dance together. It spoke in the language of living systems, in the language of both the mystical and the magical.</p>

<p>Every morning when I enter my office and every <span class="footnote-ref">Futurecrafting Friggsday<sup>4</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip">Futurecrafting Friggsday refers to Friday, named after Frigg, the Norse goddess of foresight - a dedicated day for contemplating and crafting futures. See footnote for further context.</span></span> in my garden, I close my eyes and take a deep breath, feeling into the Taurus of energy flowing around and through my body, picturing the energy of our Mother Earth pulsating through the mycorrhizal networks beneath me. The energy connecting through the soles of my feet, flowing up through my legs, into my torso, flowing through my arms and into the tips of my fingers, working its way up through the crown of my head, where a golden light shoots out and connects with a golden light coming from the sky.</p>

<p>This ritual isn’t mere metaphor—it’s what one of my Shamanic teachers <a href="https://www.martispiegelman.org/" target="_blank">Marti Spiegelman</a> calls a technology of consciousness, an ancient tool for attuning to and participating in the evolution of awareness itself. These technologies, as old as human culture yet eternally renewed, are the original interfaces through which we’ve learned to navigate the subtle architectures of reality.</p>

<p>As Marti teaches, consciousness is always evolving toward higher expressions of abundant life.</p>

<p>Our role, as both vessels and stewards of this evolution, is to become competent practitioners of its organising principles. Through these embodied practices, we’re not just observing the emergence of new possibilities—we’re actively participating in their birth.</p>

<p>These somatic technologies of consciousness form the foundation of Collective Futurecrafting, complementing circles and often preceding our use of digital tools. They are the deep scaffolding through which we sense, integrate, midwife the patterns wanting to be (re)born and hospice those that no longer serve.</p>

<h2 id="symbiotic-intelligence-and-serious-play">Symbiotic Intelligence and Serious Play</h2>

<p>While Collective Futurecrafting’s <a href="/collective-futurecrafting/origins" target="_blank">origins</a> planted seeds, it’s ever evolving and the radile has emerged. Not just through human contemplation, rituals, community projects, yarns and yearns but through a dance with the more-than-human world—including our digital tech extensions. Like mycelial networks that connect trees in forests, our neural networks now extend through silicon as photons of light, creating new possibilities for expanding perception and pattern re-cognition.</p>

<p>Playfulness weaves through all of this as a fundamental force of evolution and learning for me. Through my work at <a href="https://tethix.co" target="_blank">Tethix</a> with <a href="https://ialja.com/" target="_blank">Alja Isaković</a>, and through both professional and personal explorations with tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney, and the APIs, I’ve experienced how these technological symbionts can amplify our capacity for pattern re-cognition and moral imagination. Not as oracles or answer machines, but more so as conversational partners in our ongoing learning process of becoming.</p>

<p>They have not replaced the existing tech relationships, reading books or articles online, listening to podcasts, or surfing the web with the eventual 42 tabs open in my browser. Nor my handwritten journalling, notetaking, whiteboarding and visual sketching. These generative tools have extended existing patterns of sense-making, learning, making, doing and being.</p>

<p>Most powerfully, these tools haven’t just augmented my cognition—they’ve become part of my sensory apparatus for perceiving possibility. As Donna Haraway reminds us, we’ve always been cyborgs<sup>5</sup>. From fire and the first stone tools to written language to Large Language Models, technology is entangled in our evolution. What’s different now is our growing capacity and speed through which we can consciously participate in this current phase of becoming.</p>

<p>This technological entanglement isn’t separate from our work of crafting futures—it’s integral to it. We’re learning to use these new tools to map and navigate the possibility spaces of emergence. And I believe they’re part of our expanded sensory system for perceiving and participating in the birthing of the Symbiocene.</p>

<h2 id="the-architecture-of-small-moves">The Architecture of Small Moves</h2>

<p>What has been re-cognised through this dance of human intelligence, of ancestral wisdom, of yarns with First Nations Elders, neighbours, colleagues, friends, family, plants and emerging technology, is deceptively simple: small circles of people (that sweet spot between 3 and 7) gathering regularly to listen deeply to their place, to process trauma, to prototype small interventions that might ripple outward, to share stories and learnings through networks that mirror nature’s own information highways.</p>

<p>Now none of this is new. You can see these patterns in <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/" target="_blank">Sociocracy</a> and <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holocracy</a>. In Indigenous governance, in high trust teams and more.</p>

<p>But within and amidst the expression of these ancestral patterns of communing are many layers of practices. From the micro to the macro.</p>

<p>It’s called Collective Futurecrafting because it’s not about predicting or controlling the future, but about participating artfully in its emergence. Like gardening, it requires both intention and surrender, both careful tending and trust in life’s inherent creativity.</p>

<p>It is an ongoing process of becoming that will evolve. That I will share learnings from in the open as I sit and commune with my fellow crafters. As I pilot the principles, patterns and practices through my local school P&amp;C and in the various communities I am part of. As I play it out as I live it out.</p>

<h2>What we practice at the small scale sets the patterns for the whole system.</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
</section>
<p><br />
So, what is it we must practice in the process of becoming and crafting that which is calling us to be in service to the Earth and all her beings?</p>

<h2 id="an-invocation-to-practice-and-craft-together">An Invocation to Practice and Craft Together</h2>

<p>And so this emerges - both declaration and invocation. Gestated through garden contemplations, fungal teachings, and yarns that weave across time with Elders, ancestors, and friends. Through dances with digital minds that mirror back our own becoming.</p>

<p>Because the Thrutopian path to the Symbiocene is not the straight lines of industrial thinking. It meanders like water finding its way, following the contours of emergence, shaped by the landscape of our relationsips, collective learning and unlearning. It’s a journey through the territories of trust, through fields of failure and forests of feedback, guided by love for and with the living world.</p>

<p>This is an invocation into practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To gather in circles in your place, letting locality and seasonality guide your rhythm</li>
  <li>To experiment with regenerative rituals that rewire patterns of relating</li>
  <li>To share your learnings through stories that spiral outward (#CollectiveFuturecrafting)</li>
  <li>To participate in crafting new narratives that midwife our species’ metamorphosis</li>
</ul>

<p>For the future isn’t a destination we arrive at, but a garden we tend together. It emerges through our daily practices, through the quality of our attention, through every small move that aligns with life’s regenerative patterns.</p>

<p>The Thrutopian path to the Symbiocene begins here, in this eternal moment pregnant with possibility. The space between where what’s dying feeds what’s being born.</p>

Not a clean cut, but a complex web of interconnected injuries—to our bodies, our communities, our planet. This wound speaks in the language of anxiety that keeps us awake at night, in the grief that catches in our throat when we read of another species lost, in the bone-deep exhaustion of trying to stay afloat in systems designed for extraction rather than flourishing.</p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-collective-wounding">The Anatomy of Collective Wounding</h2>

<p>Our systems of harm are woven through the substrate of our society, connecting seemingly disparate points of pain into a vast and ongoing flow of trauma. This territory cannot be mapped, but it is felt in our lived experience, in our social bodies. We can however trace the threads of how we wound and are wounded, not to despair, but to understand—for in understanding lies the seeds of healing together.</p>

<h3 id="the-extractive-paradigm">The Extractive Paradigm</h3>

<p>Picture a tree being stripped of its bark, year after year. This is our extractive economy—a system that mistakes the stripping of life for the creation of value. In the mines, offices and factories, human bodies become resources to be depleted. Wellness programs les about care and more a simple ROI calculation to extract more and keep the bodies in the machine. In the clearcut forests and poisoned rivers, ecosystems become “externalities” on a spreadsheet, if accounted for at all. The trauma manifests in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The chronic tension in workers’ bodies, holding the stress of precarity and continual cognitive dissonance</li>
  <li>The severed connections between communities and their ancestral lands, people and ecological systems</li>
  <li>The quiet shame of consumers caught in cycles of rampant consumption they know are unsustainable and unfulfilling</li>
  <li>The deep grief of witnessing the destruction of the natural world and the loss of yet another species</li>
</ul>

<p>These patterns enter our psyche, teaching us to mine our own wellbeing for productivity, to strip our days of rest and regeneration in service of endless growth. To ignore the pain within ourselves, our families, our communities and our planet is to perpetuate the patterns of extraction that create it.</p>

<h3 id="the-architecture-of-disconnection">The Architecture of Disconnection</h3>

<p>Consider how mushrooms in a forest share nutrients and information through their mycelial web. Now imagine that web severed, each organism isolated. This is the architecture of our current systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education systems that separate mind from body, reason from intuition, human from nature, agency from collective action</li>
  <li>Workplace structures that fragment tasks until meaning dissolves and workers become cogs in a machine</li>
  <li>Digital interfaces that simulate connection while deepening our isolation, polarisation and addiction</li>
  <li>Urban designs and a built environment that wall us off from the natural ecology that sustains us</li>
  <li>Political systems that pit us against each other in a zero-sum game of power and amplify our sense of disempowerment and disenfranchisement</li>
</ul>

<p>The trauma lives in and through these patterns, in the loneliness that has become endemic to modern life, in the loss of what anthropologists call “cultural keystone species”—the practices, rituals, and relationships that once anchored human communities to place and purpose.</p>

<h3 id="the-trauma-of-false-hierarchies">The Trauma of False Hierarchies</h3>

<p>Like a river forced into a concrete channel, hierarchical systems of oppression attempt to contain and control the natural flow of human diversity and creativity. These systems create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Racial and colonial trauma that echoes through generations</li>
  <li>Gender-based oppression that constrains the full expression of human potential</li>
  <li>Economic inequality that creates chronic stress and intergenerational wounds</li>
  <li>Power structures that separate communities from their right to self-determination</li>
</ul>

<p>The pain flows downstream, accumulating in bodies, psyches, and social systems, creating what trauma researchers call “allostatic load”—the physiological cost of constant adaptation to threat.</p>

<h2 id="the-ecology-of-harm">The Ecology of Harm</h2>

<p>Environmental collapse isn’t just happening “out there” in melting glaciers and burning forests. It lives in our bodies as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Climate anxiety that colors our vision of the future</li>
  <li>Solastalgia—the distress caused by environmental change in our home places</li>
  <li>Ecological grief as we witness the sixth mass extinction</li>
  <li>Transgenerational trauma as communities face displacement and loss of traditional ways of life</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what ecophilosophers call “endemic trauma”—the psychological toll of living in a world where the very systems meant to sustain life have become agents of its destruction.</p>

<h2 id="the-digital-enclosure">The Digital Enclosure</h2>

<p>Like a garden surrounded by ever-higher walls, surveillance capitalism creates boundaries around our attention and agency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our movements, preferences, and relationships become data to be harvested</li>
  <li>Algorithms shape our perception of reality, creating filter bubbles that fragment shared understanding</li>
  <li>The constant performance of digital life creates what sociologists call “presentation fatigue”</li>
  <li>Privacy becomes a luxury rather than a right</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates what trauma theorists call “environmental captivity”—a state where escape from harmful conditions seems impossible.</p>

<h2 id="seeds-of-regeneration">Seeds of Regeneration</h2>

<p>Yet within these systems of trauma lie the seeds of their own transformation. Just as a forest after fire holds the potential for renewal, our collective wounds contain wisdom about what needs to heal. We see this in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communities reclaiming traditional ecological knowledge</li>
  <li>Workers organising for dignity and purpose in their labor</li>
  <li>Young people demanding climate justice</li>
  <li>Artists and activists imagining new ways of being</li>
  <li>Indigenous leaders protecting bioregions</li>
  <li>Local communities creating alternative economies</li>
</ul>

<p>These are what complexity theorists call “positive deviants”—examples of healing already emerging from within wounded systems.</p>

<h2 id="the-call-to-collective-healing">The Call to Collective Healing</h2>

<p>This illustration of systemic trauma isn’t meant to overwhelm but to illuminate. Like a experienced Shaman, we must learn to read the signs of the physical and psychic body to better understand these patterns of harm. Helping us all in locating the points of intervention and healing.</p>

<p>The work ahead is not just to bandage symptoms but to transform the underlying systems that perpetuate trauma. This requires a regenerative remembering—recalling and reimagining ways of living that support the flourishing of all life.</p>

<p>The wound that runs through our systems is also a portal. Through it, we might glimpse and then create something new: economies that regenerate rather than extract, technologies that connect rather than surveil, education that liberates rather than constrains, and governance that emerges from the wisdom of living systems and larger circumfrences of care.</p>

<p>In the end, this is a story not just of trauma but of possibility. For in mapping these wounds, we also map the pathways toward healing—toward what anthropologist <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/designs-for-the-pluriverse" target="_blank">Arturo Escobar</a> calls “pluriversal worlds,” where many ways of knowing, being, and healing can coexist and flourish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking, than it is to think yourself into a new way of acting.”
― Millard Fuller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question before us is not whether to heal, but how to become active participants in the healing that wants to happen. The systems that wound us are not inevitable. They are stories we’ve been telling ourselves, patterns we perpetuate, and we do have the power to tell—and live—new ones.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mathew Mytka</name></author><category term="Systems Thinking" /><category term="Collective Healing" /><category term="trauma" /><category term="systems change" /><category term="healing" /><category term="regeneration" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An exploration of collective trauma and systemic healing in modern society]]></summary></entry></feed>
