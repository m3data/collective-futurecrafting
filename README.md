# collective-futurecrafting
Dreaming up better futures together and making them real.

Collective Futurecrafting is an initiative to empower communities to dream up better futures together and enagage in active collaboration and learning to support their emergence. We ground our pattern at the hyper-local level, bringing people of all ages together in ‘Futurecrafting Circles’ to discuss, connect with, act towards and reflect on challenges relevant to them. Be that issues like climate change adaption, community resilience and wellbeing, or tech addiction, loneliness and civic engagement. But our vision goes beyond the local. We aim to create the conditions for a new model to emerge, one for how we, as Earthians, can dream and make, together. By creating networks of interconnected circles, and CLANs we can establish a fractal governance structure, enabling us to more effectively coordinate collaboration as a species. A system with a socio-cultural force and power that has the potential to transform our ways of doing, relating, knowing and being that are better attuned to the flourishing of life on this planet we call home.
