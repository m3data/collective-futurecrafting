        <h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
        <p>We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the lands on which we gather, and pay our respects to Elders past, present and emerging. We recognize their continuing connection to land, water, and community. Sovereignty was never ceded.</p>

        <h2>An Invitation</h2>
        <p>Everything presented here is both provocation and invitationâ€”to imagine differently, to gather differently, to act differently. This is not a blueprint but a living conversation about how we might craft flourishing futures together.</p>
