        <h2>In the beginning, there were circles.</h2>
        <p>Before treaties and territories, before parliaments and protocols, humans gathered in circles. Around fires that held back the dark, beneath stars that mapped our stories, we sat together—listening, sharing, dreaming of what might be. These circles were our first universities, our first governments, our first theaters of imagination.</p>
        <p>Today, as our world strains under the weight of crisis upon crisis, these ancient patterns call to us again. They whisper of a wisdom we have forgotten but not lost: the power of coming together, face to face, heart to heart, to craft futures worthy of our children's great grandchildren.</p>

        <h2>This is not nostalgia. It is necessity.</h2>
        <p>For in circles, something magical happens. Hierarchies dissolve. Stories flow. Trust builds. And in that sacred space of collective presence, we remember who we are: not isolated individuals struggling against the tide of history, but threads in a vast tapestry of life, each with the power to weave new patterns of possibility.
