Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling's foundational text delves into the theory of panarchy, which describes how ecosystems, organizations, and societies interact across scales. The book explores adaptive cycles, resilience, and cross-scale dynamics, offering key insights for designing sustainable and regenerative systems. Through its groundbreaking framework, Panarchy bridges the gap between theory and practical application in understanding human and natural systems.
