Tyson Yunkaporta’s **Right Story, Wrong Story** invites readers to rethink cultural narratives through the lens of Indigenous knowledge systems. By weaving stories, critical analysis, and practical frameworks, Yunkaporta explores how repairing 'wrong stories'—those that perpetuate harm and imbalance—can lead to systems that are more aligned with reciprocity, sustainability, and collective wellbeing. This book provides a fresh perspective for anyone working toward social, ecological, or systemic transformation.
